        <p class="intro">I have sold many books online and one thing I have always struggled with was figuring out how much profit I left after the sale. Calculating the shipping costs and transaction fees can be painstaking task so I built this "calculator" to help book-sellers, like myself, figure out the approximate price for shipping and transactions fees based on the value and weight of the book being sold.</p>
        
        <h4>The user will need to input the following values in order for the calculator to work.</h4>
        
        <p class="intro">1. <strong>Value of the Book or Books</strong> - this is the value of the book being shipped. The value is determined by the user. "BookSwap" does not determine nor influence the value determined by the user.</p>
        
        <p class="intro">2. <strong>Weight of the Book or Packaged Books</strong> - this is the weight of the total package after packing the books. In order to qualify for Media Mail, the weight cannot exceed 70 lbs per individual package. Note: Media Mail prices are based on the weight of the piece WITHOUT REGARD TO ZONE. Weights must be accurate for an accurate estimate.</p>
        
        <p class="intro">Based on the information provided, this calculator with provide you with TWO rates. The first rate that you will a provide you with the profit of the sale AFTER expenses. The second rate is an suggested sale price of the book INCLUDING all expenses in order to get the full value of the book.</p>
